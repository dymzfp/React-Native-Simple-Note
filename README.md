4. It’s one of the top mobile JavaScript frameworks among developers—and growing
5. React Native is all about the UI

### How React Native works ?
Short explanation about **How React Native Works**.

React Native invokes Objective-C APIs to render to iOS components, or Java APIs to render to Android components. This sets React Native apart from other cross-platform app development options, which often end up rendering web-based views.
